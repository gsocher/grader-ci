rest api
    - endpoints
        - receiving git webhook to start jobs
        - registering repositories (webhook endpoint will validate that it is a registered repo)
        - checking state of a job (status, log output, time?)


worker process
    - clone target repo first and then copy it over so i can parse configuration file
    - add more languages (probably java, ruby, c first)
